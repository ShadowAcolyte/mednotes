## superficial mycoses
### dermatophytoses (tinea or ringworm)
most comon superficial mycoses affecting skin, hair and nail
caused by:
- trichophyton

## subcutaneous mycoses
### mycetoma
also called maduramycosis or madura foot
- chronic slowly progressive granulomatous infection of skin and conncetive tissue
clinical manifestation - TRIAD - swelling, discharge sinus, granuloma

## systemic mycoses
deep infections of the body
caused by saprophytic fungi; spread by inhalation leading to pulmonary infection
histoplasma fungi

## opportunistic mycoses
most common fungal disease in humans, affecting skin, mucosa, internal organs
caused by:
- *Candida albicans*
- *Candida tropicalis*
- *Candida parapsilosis*
predisposing factors:
- patients on steroids/immunosuppressants
- post transplant
- malignancy
- HIV
#### cryptococcosis
hallmark of HIV - AIDS marker disease
caused by *Cryptococcus neoformans* (capsulated yeast)
affects meninges
#### zygomycosis
black fungus disease
caused by:
- rhizopus
- mucor
- zygomataca phylum
risk factors:
- diabetic ketoacidosis (very commonly seen)
highly invasive infection; surgically removed with oxygen given
#### aspergillosis
invasive allergic disease caused by hyaline mold *Aspergillus*
seen in patient with h/o tuberculosis
commonly affects lungs; seen in patients with compromised lungs

## sample collection
depends on infection site (skin scraping, nail clipping, hair plucking, sputum, swab)
systemic mycoses - blood sample

## microscopy
#### potassium hydroxide preparation
- keratinized tissue treated with 10% KOH
- digests keratin; fungal hyphae seen clearly
- 20-40% KOH - nail and hair
#### calcofluor white stain
- more sensitive than other stains
- binds to cellulose and chitin of cell wall, fluorescence under UV
#### gram stain
- yeasts(Cryptococcus) and yeast like (*Candida*)
- gram positive budding yeast cells

## culture
#### culture media
- sabourauds dextrose agar
	- MOST COMMONLY USED
#### stain
- lactophenol cotton blue
	- study microscopic appearance of fungi grown from culture
	- phenol acts as disinfectant
	- lactic acid preserves fungal morphology
