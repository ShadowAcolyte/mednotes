# dose response
## conventional dose response curves
graded dose response - individuals - greater magnitude of response with increased dose
quantal dose response - population - percentage of population affected increases with dose
- quantal - effect measured as either present or absent in individual
- quantal dose response is used to determine LD-50 of a drug

## nonmonotonic drug response curves
> curves which do not follow typical *sigmoid shape*
![[nonmonotonic-drug-response-curves.png]]
#### A. U-shaped curve
> seen for vitamins and minerals
- low doses - adverse effects due to toxicity
- dose increases - homeostasis, bottom of U-shaped curve
- high doses - overdose toxicity
#### B. hockey stick shaped curve
> toxicants like formaldehyde (metabolic by-products) for which cells have detoxifying mechanisms
- very low doses - exogenous formaldehyde does not saturate detoxifying mechanisms
- dose increases - endogenous protective mechanisms are overwhelmed causing toxic response
#### C. inverted U-shaped curve
- receptor downregulation/desensitization following ligand exposure
- additional/distinctive negative effect at concentration beyond therapeutic effect
- seen in supraphysiologic *estrogen* levels (receptor downregulation)
# toxicokinetics
> pharmacokinetics of a drug under circumstances that produce toxicity or excessive exposure
## dose dependent reactions
#### 1. pharmacological toxicity
> related to expected or intended effects of drug on the body
- CNS depression by barbiturates (anxiolysis -> sedation -> somnolence -> coma)
- degree of hypotension by nifedipine
- *Tardive dyskinesia* - extrapyramidal motor disorder associated with antipsychotic medication
- phototoxicity (sunlight exposure) at correct dose - tetracycline, sulfonamides, chlorpromazine, nalidixic acid
#### 2. pathological toxicity
> related to harmful effects of drug on tissues in body
- acetaminophen - metabolized to non-toxic (glucuronide, sulfate) conjugates and highly reactive NAPQI (via CYP isoforms)
	- NAPQI binds glutathione at normal dosage
	- at high doses, glutathione depletion leads to *hepatic necrosis*
		- shunting of NAPQI towards interactions with nucleophilic cellular macromolecules

#### 3. genotoxic toxicity
- cancer chemotherapeutic agents
## allergic reactions
#### 1. type I - anaphylactic reactions
> mediated by IgE antibodies
- Fc portion of IgE binds mast cells/basophils
- Fab binds antigen -> mediator release (histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins)
- main targets
	- GIT
		- food allergy
	- skin
		- urticaria
		- atopic dermatitis
	- respiratory tract
		- asthma
		- rhinitis
	- vasculature
		- anaphylactic shock

#### 2. type II - cytolytic reactions
> mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies, attributed to their capacity to activate the complement system
- major target are cells in circulatory system
	- penicillin induced hemolytic anemia
	- quinidine induced thrombocytopenic purpura
	- sulfonamide induced granulocytopenia
#### 3. type III - arthus reactions
> mediated predominantly by IgG, generation of antigen-antibody complexes which fix complement
- complexes deposited in vascular endothelium -> destructive inflammatory response -> serum sickness
	- urticarial skin eruptions
	- arthralgia/arthritis
	- lymphadenopathy
	- fever
#### 4. type IV - delayed hypersensitivity reactions
> mediated by sensitized T lymphocytes and macrophages
- contact dermatitis due to poison ivy
## drug-drug interaction
#### 1. interaction of absorption
> a drug may cause either increase or decrease in absorption of another drug
- *ranitidine* - H2 antagonist -> increase GIT pH -> enhances basic drug absorption (*triazolam*)
- *cholestyramine* - bile acid sequestrant -> decreases serum concentration of *propranolol*
#### 2. interaction of protein binding
- highly protein bound drugs - aspirin, barbiturates, phenytoin, sulfonamides, valproic acid, warfarin
- enhanced toxicity
	- protein binding sites become saturated (hypoalbuminemia)
	- displaced from plasma protein by other drugs
#### 3. interaction of metabolism
> especially seen when hepatic CYPs are involved
- ethanol induced CYP2E1
- acetaminophen metabolized to NAPQI by CYP2E1 ([[#2. pathological toxicity]])
#### 4. interaction of receptor binding
- buprenorphine - opioid with partial agonist and antagonist activity
- binds to opiate receptors with high affinity -> prevents euphoria from narcotic abuse
- *used to treat opioid addiction*
## idiosyncratic reactions
> abnormal reactivity to a chemical that is peculiar to a given individual
