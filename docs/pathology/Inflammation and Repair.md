# General Overview
> Inflammation is a response of vascularized tissue that delivers leukocytes and molecules of host defense from circulation to sites of infection and cell damage to eliminate the offending agents.

*Suffix -itis after an organ denotes inflammation - appendicitis, conjunctivitis, meningitis, etc.*

#### Typical Inflammatory Reaction Steps:
1. Recognition
	- Cells of inflammation have receptors which identify microbial products and substances released from damaged cells.
	- Receptor activation -> release of inflammation mediators.
2. Recruitment
    - Coordinated changes in blood vessels and mediator secretion.
    - Leukocytes and proteins (complement) move to site of injury.
3. Removal
    - Phagocytic cells ingest and destroy offending agents.
4. Regulation of response (and termination)
5. Repair
    - Tissue repair
## Causes
1. Infection and microbial toxins
2. Tissue necrosis
3. Foreign bodies (splinters, dirt, suture), even a few endogenous molecules.
	- Urate crystals - gout
	- Cholesterol - atherosclerosis
	- Lipids - obesity associated metabolic syndrome
4. Immune reactions (hypersensitivity)
## Recognition of Microbes and Damaged Cells
*Initiating step in inflammatory response*
- Cellular receptors for microbes
	- Receptors expressed in plasma membranes (extracellular microbes), endosomes (ingested microbes), cytosol (intracellular microbes).
	- Best defined - *[[Toll-like receptors (TLRs)]]*
- Sensors of cell damage
	- *[[NOD-like receptors (NLRs)]]*
- Other cellular receptors
	- Fc tails of antibodies
	- Complement proteins
- Circulating proteins
	- Complement system
	- *Mannose-binding lectin* - recognizes microbial sugars
		- Promotes ingestion of microbes.
		- Activation of complement system.
	- *Collectin proteins* - bind to and combat microbes
# Acute Inflammation
3 major components:
1. Dilation of small vessels -> increase in blood flow.
2. Increased permeability of microvasculature -> plasma proteins and leukocytes leave circulation.
3. Emigration of leukocytes from microcirculation -> accumulation in focus of injury -> activation to eliminate offending agent.
## Reactions of Blood Vessels
> Maximize movement of plasma proteins and leukocytes out of circulation into focus of injury

**Exudation** - escape of fluid, proteins, and blood cells from vasculature into interstitial tissue or body cavities.
**Exudate** - extravascular fluid with high protein concentration and cellular debris.
- Presence implies inflammatory process resulting in increased vascular permeability.
**Transudate** - extravascular fluid with low protein content, little to no cellular debris and low specific gravity.
- Ultrafiltrate of blood plasma.
- *Result of osmotic/hydrostatic imbalance without changes in permeability*.
**Edema**- accumulation of excess fluid in interstitial tissue or serous cavity (either exudate or transudate).
**Pus** - purulent inflammatory exudate, rich in leukocytes (mostly neutrophils), dead cell debris, and often microbes.

#### 1. Changes in vascular flow and caliber
- Vasodilation, induced by mediators, especially histamine on vascular smooth muscle.
	- *Earliest manifestation of acute inflammation*.
	- Opening of new capillary beds in the area -> increased blood flow -> heat and redness (erythema) at site of inflammation.
- Vasodilation followed by [[#2. Increased vascular permeability]].
- Loss of fluid and increased vessel diameter.
	- Slower blood flow, concentration of RBCs in small vessels, and increased viscosity of blood.
	- Engorgement of small vessels with slow moving RBCs called *stasis*.
- As stasis develops, blood leukocytes (mainly neutrophils) accumulate along vascular endothelium.
#### 2. Increased vascular permeability
- Contraction of endothelial cells -> opening of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">inter-endothelial gaps</mark>.
	- Histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes, other mediators.
	- *Immediate transient response* - occurs rapidly after exposure and usually short lived.
- Endothelial injury -> endothelial necrosis and detachment.
	- Neutrophils adhering to endothelium during inflammation may damage them and amplify response.
	- Sustained for several hours until damaged vessels are thrombosed or repaired.
#### 3. Responses of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes
- Lymph flow increased to help drain edema fluid accumulation due to increased permeability.
- Vessels proliferate to handle increased load.
- Secondary inflammation
	- *Lymphangitis* - lymphatics
		- Presence of red streaks (inflamed lymphatics, diagnostic of lymphangitis) near skin wound indicate bacterial infection.
	- *Lymphadenitis* - draining lymph nodes
		- Often enlarged due to hyperplasia of follicles and increased lymphocytes/macrophages.
Collection of pathologic changes -> *reactive, or inflammatory, lymphadenitis*.
## Leukocyte Recruitment to Site of Inflammation
> Journey of leukocytes from vessel lumen to tissue is a multistep process mediated and controlled by adhesion molecules and cytokines called *chemokines*.

*Most important leukocytes -> capable of phagocytosis -> neutrophils and macrophages.*
#### 1. Leukocyte adhesion to endothelium
Margination - process of leukocyte redistribution, where the cells assume a peripheral position due to dilation of inflamed postcapillary venules and stasis (slow blood flow).
**Attachment of leukocytes to endothelial cells is mediated by adhesion molecules whose expression is enhanced by cytokines.**
- Secreted by sentinel cells in response to microbes/injurious agents.
- *Selectins* - mediate initial rolling action.
	- Expressed on leukocytes (L-selectin), endothelium (E-selectin), platelets and endothelium (*P-selectin*).
	- Expression of selectins and their ligands mediated by cytokines.
	- TNF and IL-1 -> endothelial cells of postcapillary venules.
		- Expression of E-selectin and ligands for L-selectin.
	- Histamine and thrombin -> P-selectin from intracellular storage onto surface.
		- *Weibel-Palade bodies* - endothelial cell granules containing P-selectin.
	- Low-affinity binding -> leukocytes bind, detach, and bind, causing them to roll along the endothelial surface.
- *Integrins* - heterodimeric leukocyte surface proteins, mediate *firm adhesion*.
	- TNF and IL-1 -> endothelial expression of integrin ligands.
		- VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule) -> beta-1 integrin **VLA-4.**
		- ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule) -> beta-2 integrins **LFA-1** and **MAC-1**.
- Chemokines bind to and activate leukocytes.
	- Conversion of VLA-4 and LFA-1 to high-affinity state.
#### 2. Leukocyte migration through endothelium
> Migration of leukocytes through intact endothelium called *transmigration* or *diapedesis*, mainly in postcapillary venules.
- Adhesion molecules present in intercellular junctions between endothelial cells.
	- CD31 or PECAM-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule).
	- Help them transverse endothelium.
- Leukocytes pierce the basement membrane by secreting *collagenases*.
**Genetic deficiencies in adhesion molecules result in increased susceptibility to bacterial infections.**
#### 3. Chemotaxis of leukocytes
> Movement of leukocytes in tissues towards the site of injury, mediated through chemokines, along their concentration gradient.
- Chemotactic substances
	- Exogenous
		- Bacterial peptides with N-formyl methionine terminal and lipids.
	- Endogenous
		- Cytokines - IL-8
		- Complement system - C5a
		- Arachidonic acid metabolites - leukotriene B4 (LTB4)
	- Bind G protein -> actin polymerization + myosin localization -> cytoskeleton rearrangement -> movement through *filopodia.*
- Nature of leukocyte infiltrate:
	- Neutrophils respond first, undergo apoptosis first too.
	- Monocytes survive longer, may also proliferate within tissue.
	- Exceptions
		- *Pseudomonas* - continuously recruited neutrophils.
		- Viral infections - lymphocytes arrive first.
		- Hypersensitivity - lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells.
		- Helminthic/allergic - eosinophils.
