# General Overview
> Inflammation is a response of vascularized tissue that delivers leukocytes and molecules of host defense from circulation to sites of infection and cell damage to eliminate the offending agents

*Suffix -itis after an organ denotes inflammation - appendicitis, conjunctivitis, meningitis, etc.*

#### Typical Inflammatory Reaction Steps:
1. Recognition
	- Cells of inflammation have receptors which identify microbial products and substances released from damaged cells
	- Receptor activation -> release of inflammation mediators
2. Recruitment
    - Coordinated changes in blood vessels and mediator secretion
    - Leukocytes and proteins (complement) move to site of injury
3. Removal
    - Phagocytic cells ingest and destroy offending agents
4. Regulation of response (and termination)
5. Repair
    - Tissue repair
## Causes
1. Infection and microbial toxins
2. Tissue necrosis
3. Foreign bodies (splinters, dirt, suture), even a few endogenous molecules
	- urate crystals - gout
	- cholesterol - atherosclerosis
	- lipids - obesity associated metabolic syndrome
4. Immune reactions (hypersensitivity)
## Recognition of Microbes and Damaged Cells
*Initiating step in inflammatory response*
- Cellular receptors for microbes
	- Receptors expressed in plasma membranes (extracellular microbes), endosomes (ingested microbes), cytosol (intracellular microbes)
	- Best defined - *[[Toll-like receptors (TLRs)]]*
- Sensors of cell damage
	- *[[NOD-like receptors (NLRs)]]*
- Other cellular receptors
	- Fc tails of antibodies
	- Complement proteins
- Circulating proteins
	- Complement system
	- *Mannose-binding lectin* - recognizes microbial sugars
		- promotes ingestion of microbes
		- activation of complement system
	- *Collectin proteins* - bind to and combat microbes
# Acute Inflammation
3 major components:
1. Dilation of small vessels -> increase in blood flow
2. Increased permeability of microvasculature -> plasma proteins and leukocytes leave circulation
3. Emigration of leukocytes from microcirculation -> accumulation in focus of injury -> activation to eliminate offending agent
## Reactions of Blood Vessels
> Maximize movement of plasma proteins and leukocytes out of circulation into focus of injury

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Exudation</mark> - escape of fluid, proteins, and blood cells from vasculature into interstitial tissue or body cavities.
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Exudate</mark> - extravascular fluid with high protein concentration and cellular debris.
- Presence implies inflammatory process resulting in increased vascular permeability
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Transudate</mark> - extravascular fluid with low protein content, little to no cellular debris and low specific gravity.
- ultrafiltrate of blood plasma
- *result of osmotic/hydrostatic imbalance without changes in permeability*
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Edema</mark> - accumulation of excess fluid in interstitial tissue or serous cavity (either exudate or transudate).
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Pus</mark> - purulent inflammatory exudate, rich in leukocytes (mostly neutrophils), dead cell debris, and often microbes.

#### 1. Changes in vascular flow and caliber
- Vasodilation, induced by mediators, especially histamine on vascular smooth muscle
	- *Earliest manifestation of acute inflammation*
	- Opening of new capillary beds in the area -> increased blood flow -> heat and redness (erythema) at site of inflammation
- Vasodilation followed by [[#2. Increased vascular permeability]]
- Loss of fluid and increased vessel diameter
	- Slower blood flow, concentration of RBCs in small vessels, and increased viscosity of blood
	- Engorgement of small vessels with slow moving RBCs called *stasis*
- As stasis develops, blood leukocytes (mainly neutrophils) accumulate along vascular endothelium
#### 2. Increased vascular permeability
- Contraction of endothelial cells -> opening of inter-endothelial gaps
	- Histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes, other mediators
	- *Immediate transient response* - occurs rapidly after exposure and usually short lived
- Endothelial injury -> endothelial necrosis and detachment
	- Neutrophils adhering to endothelium during inflammation may damage them and amplify response
	- Sustained for several hours until damaged vessels are thrombosed or repaired
#### 3. Responses of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes
- Lymph flow increased to help drain edema fluid accumulation due to increased permeability
- Vessels proliferate to handle increased load
- Secondary inflammation
	- *Lymphangitis* - lymphatics
		- Presence of red streaks (inflamed lymphatics, diagnostic of lymphangitis) near skin wound indicate bacterial infection
	- *Lymphadenitis* - draining lymph nodes
		- Often enlarged due to hyperplasia of follicles and increased lymphocytes/macrophages
Collection of pathologic changes -> *reactive, or inflammatory, lymphadenitis*.
## Leukocyte Recruitment to Site of Inflammation
> Journey of leukocytes from vessel lumen to tissue is a multistep process mediated and controlled by adhesion molecules and cytokines called *chemokines*

*Most important leukocytes -> capable of phagocytosis -> neutrophils and macrophages.*
#### 1. Leukocyte adhesion to endothelium
