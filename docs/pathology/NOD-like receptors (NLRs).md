> Recognize diverse molecules that are liberated or altered as a consequence of cellular damage.
## Molecules
- Uric acid - DNA breakdown product
- Adenosine triphosphate - damaged mitochondria
- Reduced intracellular K+ - plasma membrane injury associated ion loss
- DNA released into cytoplasm and not sequestered in nuclei like normal
Receptors activate a multiprotein enzyme complex called [[#inflammasome]].
## Inflammasome
> Induces production of cytokine interleukin-1
- IL-1 recruits leukocytes and induces inflammation
- Implicated in:
	1. Gout - urate crystals
	2. Metabolic syndrome and obesity associated type 2 diabetes - lipids
	3. Atherosclerosis - cholesterol crystals
	4. Alzheimer's disease - amyloid deposits in brain
Mutations in genes encoding the receptors are cause of rare diseases grouped under *autoinflammatory syndromes*.
